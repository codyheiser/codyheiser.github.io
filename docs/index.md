## Summary

Computational systems biologist and Senior Scientist in Molecular Profiling & Data Science at Regeneron, investigating mechanisms of resistance to bispecific antibody therapeutics using multimodal profiling across humanized mouse tumor models and clinical datasets.

I earned my Ph.D. in Chemical & Physical Biology from Vanderbilt University, where my work in spatial multi-omics and single-cell analysis led to a U.S. patent-pending colorectal cancer immune exclusion signature and two open-source Python packages: `MILWRM` for tissue domain detection and `dropkick` for scRNA-seq quality control. My research has appeared in *Cell*, *Genome Research*, and *Cell Reports*, among other peer-reviewed publications. Before Regeneron, I built production ML pipelines end to end at Decode Health and advanced diagnostics development under cGMP and CE/US-IVD standards at Asuragen. I hold a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. I’m driven by modeling and integrating high-dimensional data to map cancer initiation, progression, and the co-evolution of the tumor microenvironment.

Relevant experience in current role:

* Build scalable software and standardized pipelines for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, TCR, and ATAC-seq in distributed computing environments
* Apply modern AI/ML to accelerate discovery—using LLM-powered named entity recognition for metadata harmonization
* Contribute to enterprise RAG-LLM initiatives - constructing and querying biomedical knowledge graphs within graph databases
* Pilot and operationalize emerging LLM tools for literature and knowledge discovery
* Regularly utilize LLMs such as GitHub Copilot to speed and scale robust code development
